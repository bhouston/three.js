/**
 * Turns a trained tangent-space (dx, dy) offset into the mesh's final
 * view-space normal. The network only predicts the 2-component offset (see
 * NeuralMaterialFormat.js's 'tanh'-activated `normal`/`clearcoatNormal`
 * channels) - z is reconstructed here as the positive root
 * `sqrt(1 - dx*dx - dy*dy)`, matching the always-positive-hemisphere
 * tangent-space z that MaterialX's own `normalNode` produces (the same
 * assumption the old full-vector encoding relied on: this z was always ~1,
 * never actually trained as an independent degree of freedom).
 *
 * This is NOT the standard three.js `normalMap(texture, scale)` convention,
 * where the returned vector is left in tangent space and the base
 * `NodeMaterial.setupNormal()` pipeline transforms it downstream using
 * whatever mesh it's applied to - `setupNormal()` actually uses `normalNode`
 * verbatim as the final normal, no further transform. MaterialX's own
 * `<normalmap>` conversion (see examples/jsm/loaders/materialx/
 * MaterialXNodeLibrary.js's mx_normalmap + MaterialXSurfaceMappings.js's
 * transformNormalToView(...) call) does the tangent/bitangent/normal blend
 * *inside* the graph itself, using whatever mesh that graph gets built
 * against - which is why baking that node's output on our flat training
 * quad and reapplying it verbatim to the torus knot was wrong for any real
 * (non-constant) bump detail: the baked value is relative to the quad's own
 * orientation, not a portable tangent-space vector, and setupNormal() never
 * re-blends it per-mesh. This function replicates that same blend here, but
 * against tangentWorld/bitangentWorld/normalWorld as resolved for whatever
 * mesh THIS material is actually applied to (the torus knot) - these are
 * dynamic per-mesh TSL accessors, so this "just works" the same way
 * MaterialX's own conversion does when applied directly to a mesh.
 *
 * Shared (via `OUTPUT_TYPES.normal.reconstruct` below) by both the `normal`
 * and `clearcoatNormal` channel descriptors in NeuralMaterialFormat.js -
 * moved here, out of NeuralMaterialNodeMaterial.js, so it's reusable by any
 * channel descriptor (built-in or caller-supplied) that declares itself
 * `type: 'normal'`, not just those two hardcoded call sites. Still
 * re-exported from NeuralMaterialNodeMaterial.js for backward compatibility
 * with existing imports/tests.
