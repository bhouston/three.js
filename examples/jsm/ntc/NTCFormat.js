/**
 * Full vocabulary of standard PBR channels this trainer knows how to fit,
 * jointly, with one shared grid + MLP network (NVIDIA neural texture
 * compression style: one small decoder, many correlated output channels).
 *
 * A given material only *trains* the subset of these channels it actually
 * drives with a node graph (texture/procedural) - see
 * `NTCSource.classifyMaterialChannels` - so the network's output
 * width, and the sample cost of every training iteration, scale with how
 * much of the material is actually spatially-varying rather than always
 * paying for all of them. `nodeKeys` is what that classification checks:
 * a channel is "active" (worth training) iff at least one of its node
 * properties is set on the source material; otherwise it's read once as a
 * plain constant and applied directly, bypassing the network entirely.
 *
 * `activation` is the output nonlinearity applied to this channel's slice of
 * the decoder's (always-linear, see NTCGridPyramidModel.js) raw output - see
 * ./NTCOutputActivations.js - chosen to match each channel's natural
 * physical range instead of forcing every channel through the same
 * unbounded linear output:
 *  - 'sigmoid': bounded [0,1] scalars/colors (reflectance, coverage,
 *    roughness-like properties).
 *  - 'tanh': bounded [-1,1] signed vectors (tangent-space normal offsets,
 *    anisotropy direction) - trained/consumed directly in that range, no
 *    extra `*0.5+0.5` remap needed.
 *  - 'softplus': unbounded, non-negative HDR values (emission) - smooth and
 *    non-exploding, unlike a raw exponential, for an undertrained decoder's
 *    large pre-activations.
 * Anything without an explicit `activation` falls back to plain linear
 * (matching every other MLP output in this codebase).
 */

/**
 * `clampRange` and `defaultValue` (alongside `activation`/`nodeKeys`/`size`
 * above) are what let `NTCNodeMaterial`'s constructor and
 * `NTCSource`'s node/constant resolvers be driven by a loop
 * instead of one hand-written branch per channel.
 *
 * `clampRange` is the range this channel's *trained* value is clamped to
 * before use (a trained value has no hard guarantee of landing in its
 * activation's nominal range - see `previewColor`'s doc comment). `null`
 * means "don't clamp" - used for vector-valued channels that get a
 * different, channel-specific treatment instead (normal reconstruction,
 * anisotropy's hypot/atan2, unbounded emission).
 *
 * `defaultValue` is what a *constant* (untrained) channel falls back to when
 * the source material doesn't set even the corresponding plain property -
 * matching three.js's own `MeshPhysicalMaterial` defaults for that property.
 *
 * A constant channel's resolved value is applied via `applyConstant` as a
 * literal TSL constant node (`float(...)`/`vec2(...)`/`vec3(...)`) assigned
 * onto the reconstructed material's `*Node` property - not the plain
 * (non-`Node`) property. Setting the plain property (e.g. `material.roughness
 * = 0.4`) would route through three.js's `MaterialReferenceNode` machinery
 * (see `materialRoughness` in src/nodes/accessors/MaterialNode.js), which
 * reads `material.roughness` back out as a live GPU uniform every frame - a
 * value the shader compiler can never constant-fold, dead-code-eliminate
 * around, or otherwise specialize on, because from its perspective it's
 * indistinguishable from a value that might change later. Assigning a TSL
 * constant node instead bakes the literal directly into the generated
 * shader source, exactly like an *active* (trained) channel's slice does -
 * so a constant channel and a trained one differ only in whether their value
 * came from the network or from the source material, not in how "constant"
 * either one is to the compiler.
 *

 * This is an *open, composable* vocabulary, not a hardcoded switch: every
 * channel below carries its own `resolveNode`/`resolveConstant` (how to pull
 * this channel's raw value off a source `MeshPhysicalNodeMaterial`, as a TSL
 * node or a plain JS value respectively - see NTCSource.js) and
 * `applyActive`/`applyConstant` (how to apply a trained slice, or a resolved
 * constant, onto a reconstructed `NTCNodeMaterial` - see
 * NTCNodeMaterial.js). `NTCSource.js` and
 * `NTCNodeMaterial.js` are both just generic loops driven by
 * these four functions per channel - there's no per-key branching left in
 * either file, so a caller can compose an entirely different channel array
 * (new named outputs, with their own resolution/application logic) and pass
 * it through `classifyMaterialChannels`/`resolveMaterialChannelNodes`/
 * `NTCNodeMaterial`'s constructor via their `channels` option,
 * without editing this file at all. `CHANNELS` below is simply the built-in,
 * default vocabulary those entry points fall back to.
 *
 * `type` is an optional label (see NTCOutputTypes.js's `OUTPUT_TYPES`/
 * `channelEffectiveType`) identifying a channel's reconstruction/preview
 * shape beyond its raw trained `size` - e.g. `'normal'` for a channel that
 * trains a 2-component tangent-space offset but reconstructs/previews as a
 * full 3-component vector. Channels that don't need this can omit it; it
 * defaults to a generic size-based label ('float'/'float2'/'float3').
