/**
 * Builds one real GPU mipmap-chain `DataTexture` from a trained CPU model's
 * stored feature-grid pyramid (`cpuModel.grids`, finest-first - see
 * NTCGridModel.js's `computeGridLevels`), so the runtime can sample it once
 * with hardware trilinear filtering (`textureLevel(...)`) instead
 * of sampling every stored level separately and hard-selecting one via an
 * equality mask (see NTCDecoderTSL.js).
 *
 * The stored pyramid does not map 1:1 onto a GPU mip chain when
 * `mipsPerLevel > 1`: each stored level is reused, via the decoder's LOD
 * input, to reconstruct `mipsPerLevel` different physical mips (see
 * NTCMipBands.js), whereas a real mip chain needs data at *every*
 * intermediate physical mip. This builds that missing data by box-filter-
 * downsampling each stored level's own data across its band, rather than by
 * literally duplicating one fixed-resolution image at mismatched sizes
 * (which a real mip chain's `floor(prev/2)`-per-level size rule forbids
 * outright). Two things follow from that:
 *
 * - Within one stored level's band, hardware trilinear sampling now
 *   interpolates between genuinely different (progressively blurrier) mip
 *   images, rather than between duplicates of the same image - a strictly
 *   better minification approximation of what that stored level "means" at
 *   each physical mip than duplication would give, and still cheap (a plain
 *   box filter, computed once at texture-build time, not per-frame).
 * - Training (NTCGPUComputeTSL.js) is unaffected: it always samples a
 *   selected level's data at that level's own native resolution, regardless
 *   of which physical mip within the band a given training sample targets -
 *   the LOD scalar concatenated onto the decoder's input is what lets the
 *   MLP disambiguate those physical mips from a fixed-resolution tap, not
 *   the tap's own resolution. This mip-chain construction is a runtime-only
 *   reinterpretation of already-trained data; it doesn't require a `.ntc`
 *   format change or retraining.
 * - Across the boundary *between* two stored levels' bands, trilinear
 *   sampling now blends smoothly between two independently-trained levels'
 *   reconstructions where before it snapped 0/1 discontinuously - this is
 *   the actual fix motivating this whole builder (see this addon's Stage 2
 *   design notes: a hard level switch pops visibly as LOD crosses that
 *   boundary; genuine hardware trilinear removes the pop as a side effect
 *   of the storage change, not as separate new blending code).
 *
 * The last stored level has no next level to hand off to, so its "band"
 * covers every remaining physical mip down to 1x1 (an open-ended tail,
 * exactly matching `NTCMipBands.selectFeatureLevel`'s own clamp) - its box-
 * filter pyramid is simply built deep enough to reach the chain's actual
 * end instead of stopping after `mipsPerLevel` steps.
 *
 * `interpolation` (default `true`) controls filtering *within* each physical
 * mip level only - `true` is genuine trilinear (`LinearMipmapLinearFilter` +
 * `LinearFilter`, as above); `false` swaps to nearest-neighbor within a level
 * (`NearestMipmapLinearFilter` + `NearestFilter`) while still blending
 * *between* mip levels exactly as before - useful for visually inspecting
 * the trained feature grid's actual stored texels (see NTCNodeMaterial.js's
 * `setInterpolation`) without the bilinear blur that otherwise always hides
 * them. This only ever changes the GPU sampler's filter mode, never the
 * texture's data - see `updateSampler`'s per-binding `samplerKey`
 * (src/renderers/webgpu/utils/WebGPUTextureUtils.js), so toggling it doesn't
 * require rebuilding the texture, the model, or reloading anything.
