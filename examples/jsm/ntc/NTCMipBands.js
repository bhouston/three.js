// kernel (NTCGPUComputeTSL.js) and the runtime decoder (NTCDecoderTSL.js) so
// the two can never disagree about which grid level a given LOD selects.
// Kept in this parent (non-`training/`) folder, like NTCFormat.js, since the
// runtime decode path needs it without pulling in any training-only
// dependency.
//
// This is what reproduces the NVIDIA neural texture compression paper's
// actual storage-compression mechanism (Section 4.1/Table 1): a handful of
// stored feature levels (`levels`, small - e.g. 3 or 4), each reused, via
// the decoder's own explicit LOD input, to reconstruct `mipsPerLevel`
// different physical mip levels - not one stored grid per mip level (which
// is what a real GPU mipmap chain would be, and is *not* what this addon's
// pyramid is; see NTCGridModel.js's `computeGridLevels`). The mapping itself
// is intentionally uniform-width (`floor(lod / mipsPerLevel)`), not a
// faithful copy of Table 1's asymmetric per-level widths - see
// NTCGridModel.js's `DEFAULT_MIPS_PER_LEVEL` doc comment - but it keeps the
// paper's key property that the *last* stored level absorbs every LOD past
// its own band as an open-ended tail: once `lod` grows large enough that
// `floor(lod / mipsPerLevel) >= levels - 1`, every further LOD still clamps
// to that same last level, exactly like the paper's own last feature level
// "cannot be further downsampled".
