 * space LOD heuristic, and it means this only needs `maxLod`, which (unlike

 * a model loaded from a `.ntc` file (see NTCLoader.js).

 * derived estimate before clamping - the same sign convention as WebGL/
 * WebGPU's own sampler LOD bias (positive lowers the *reconstructed* LOD,
 * i.e. keeps a finer/higher-resolution stored level in use for longer as
 * the surface recedes; negative pushes toward coarser levels sooner). This
 * addon's own reconstruction can afford to stay fine longer than ordinary
 * mipmapped textures would: since the last stored level absorbs every LOD
 * past its own band as an open-ended tail (see NTCMipBands.js), aliasing
 * from under-blurring at a moderate positive bias is bounded by the MLP's
 * own reconstruction, not by an unfiltered raw texture read - a positive
