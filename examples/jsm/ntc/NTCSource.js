 * below).
 *
 * A channel without its own `resolveNode` (only possible for a caller-
 * supplied `alwaysConstant` channel that skips node resolution entirely -

 * Splits a material's channels into the ones worth training (driven by a

 * with no node at all) - so the network's output width, and the cost of
 * every training sample, scale with how much of the material actually
 * varies rather than always paying for the full channel vocabulary.
 * Constant channels are applied directly as ordinary material properties at
 * reconstruction time, bypassing the network entirely (see
 * NTCNodeMaterial.js).
 *
 * This is a node-presence heuristic, not a pixel-level analysis: a channel
 * is "active" (trained) iff at least one of its `nodeKeys` is set on the
 * material, regardless of whether that node's output actually varies once
 * evaluated - a texture-driven channel that happens to be uniform everywhere
 * still gets trained (harmlessly - a constant target is trivially fit, see
 * the flat-velvet-color regression test in NTCTrainer). An earlier
 * version of this function baked and read back each candidate channel to
 * measure its real variance and reclassify accordingly; that added real
 * complexity and failure surface (a GPU readback round trip per material
 * load) without a clear net win, so it's been backed out in favor of this
 * simpler, synchronous check.
 *
 * A channel descriptor may instead set `alwaysConstant: true` with a fixed
 * `constantValue` baked in at spec-construction time, to declare a value
 * that's *never* trained and never even checks `nodeKeys` - e.g. a value a
 * caller's custom channel array wants surfaced through `constantValues`
 * (and applied via `applyConstant`) for every material, without offering any
 * node-driven path to vary it at all.
 *
 * `channels` defaults to the built-in `CHANNELS` vocabulary, but accepts any
 * caller-supplied channel array (built-in descriptors, custom ones, or a mix)
 * - this function has no hardcoded knowledge of any particular channel key.
