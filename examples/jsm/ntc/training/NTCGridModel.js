/**
 * Computes the per-level grid resolutions for a genuine (paper-style) mip
 * pyramid: `baseResolution` is the finest (mip 0) level's resolution, and
 * each subsequent stored *feature* level is `mipsPerLevel` mip-halvings
 * coarser than the previous one - e.g. `computeGridLevels(128, 3, 2)` ->
 * `[128, 32, 8]` (each level a quarter the resolution of the last, i.e. 2
 * halvings apart). This is deliberately not a 1:1 grid-level-per-mip-level
 * mapping - see NTCMipBands.js's `selectFeatureLevel`, which maps a
 * continuous/discrete target LOD down onto one of these (far fewer) stored
 * levels, exactly like the NVIDIA neural texture compression paper's Table 1
 * (a handful of feature levels, each reused via the decoder's LOD input to
 * reconstruct several physical mips - see that file's doc comment for how
 * this reproduces the paper's actual storage-compression mechanism).
 *
 * Level 0 (index 0, the array's first entry) is always the finest/base
 * resolution. `baseResolution` is clamped to `[1, MAX_GRID_RESOLUTION]` and
 * rounded to the nearest integer; `levels` and `mipsPerLevel` are each
 * clamped to >= 1 and rounded.
