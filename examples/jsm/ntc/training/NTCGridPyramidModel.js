/**
 * Single source of truth for the model-shape options shared by the CPU
 * model, the GPU training layout, and the trainer's defaults. Resolving
 * these once here - rather than each of those three re-declaring the same
 * defaults independently - means they can't silently drift apart.
 *
 * `textureResolution` (the source texture's largest dimension) determines
 * `maxLod` - the total mip range this model is meant to support, down to
 * 1x1 - independently of how many feature levels are actually *stored*
 * (`levels`/`mipsPerLevel`, see NTCGridModel.js/NTCMipBands.js): a handful of
 * stored levels can still be asked to reconstruct a much deeper mip chain,
 * each level just gets reused for more than one of those mips.
 *
 * `baseResolution` (the *finest* stored grid's resolution) defaults to
 * `textureResolution` itself (capped at `MAX_GRID_RESOLUTION`) when not given
 * explicitly - this matters: LOD 0 always means "reconstruct the source
 * texture's own mip 0", so if the finest grid were left far coarser than the
 * texture (e.g. a fixed small default while the texture is large), the model
 * would be asked to reconstruct much more detail at LOD 0 than its finest
 * grid could ever hold, and - since `levels`/`mipsPerLevel` only cover a
 * `levels * mipsPerLevel`-mip-deep band before the *last* stored level
 * becomes an open-ended tail (see NTCMipBands.js) - most realistic viewing
 * distances would land on that same tiny tail level, looking close to a flat
 * color. Tying the default finest resolution to the real texture resolution
 * keeps LOD 0 meaningful without the caller having to know to set
 * `baseResolution` explicitly. Falls back to a fixed 128 only when neither
 * `baseResolution` nor `textureResolution` is known (e.g. a model built by
 * hand, with no real texture in the picture at all).
