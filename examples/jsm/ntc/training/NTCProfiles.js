/**
 * Named compression-profile presets, bundling the grid/MLP shape knobs
 * (`NTCGridModel.js`'s `GRID_LEVELS_OPTIONS`/`GRID_BASE_RESOLUTION_OPTIONS`/
 * `MLP_HIDDEN_SIZE_OPTIONS`/`MLP_ACTIVATION_OPTIONS`) that would otherwise
 * have to be hand-tuned as 4 independent options, loosely modeled on the
 * NVIDIA neural texture compression paper's own named profiles (Table 2:
 * NTC 0.2/0.5/1.0/2.25 bits-per-pixel-per-channel), but chosen here for
 * decode-cost/compatibility tiers rather than a fixed bpp target - actual
 * storage size and quality both still depend on the source material's
 * resolution and channel count (see NTCModelSize.js's
 * computeModelFootprint for the exact byte accounting).
 *
 * `mobile-fast` mirrors the mobile-oriented defaults sketched in this repo's
 * `EXT_neural_textures.md` draft (1 hidden layer, width 16, targeting
 * roughly <=800 FLOPs/pixel) - it trades reconstruction quality for the
 * smallest decoder (fewest weights, fewest ALU ops per shaded pixel,
 * smallest fp32-uniform fallback footprint on devices without WebGPU
 * `shader-f16` - see NTCMLPTSL.js's supportsHalfPrecisionStorage) and is the
 * safest default for unknown/low-end mobile hardware.
 *
 * `mobile-balanced` is this addon's own long-standing default shape (2
 * hidden layers of width 32, relu) - already a reasonable middle ground
 * that plenty of mobile GPUs handle comfortably, just given a name here
 * rather than being an implicit, undocumented default.
 *
 * `desktop-quality` is the closest match in this codebase to the NVIDIA
 * paper's own default decoder (Section 4.4: 2 hidden layers of width 64,
 * hardGELU) - the highest reconstruction quality of the three, at the
 * highest per-pixel decode cost (4x the hidden-layer weights of
 * mobile-balanced, plus hardGELU's extra ALU ops per neuron over relu's
 * single max() - see NTCMLPTSL.js's evaluateLinearLayerMat4). Best suited to
 * desktop-class GPUs or contexts where decode cost is not the bottleneck.
 *
 * Every profile only sets `levels`/`baseResolution`/`hiddenSizes`/
 * `hiddenActivation` - `channels`, `outputChannels`, `mipsPerLevel`,
 * `quantization`, batch/iteration/learning-rate settings, etc. are left to
 * the caller (NTCTrainer.js's own defaults, or the source material's actual
 * channel layout) exactly as they would be without a profile applied.
